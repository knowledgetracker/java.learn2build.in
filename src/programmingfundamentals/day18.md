2. For the same problem in 1., perform validations to avoid DivideByZero Arithmetic Exception to occur on the divide method. Write a test case to check if the validation works correctly.
3. For the `UserValidator.validate(User user)` method created on Day 13 please write JUNIT Test cases. Please ensure to create test methods for each of the paths of  your validate method: including error paths.
